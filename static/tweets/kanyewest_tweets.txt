Fixing Wolves 2day... Worked on it for 3 weeks. Life Of Pablo is a living breathing changing creative expression. #contemporaryart
Utah has eliminated homelessness by 91%
Non artist trying to grab the paint brush...
My tweets are a form of contemporary art only compromised by people trying to tell me what to tweet and not to tweet...
no one can ask me or try to tell me what to Instagram... It's my art...
on another note... I was thinking about getting an Instagram but only on one condition......
%1000 Steve Ballmer. Let's meet this week if you have time. I was hanging with Chris Paul last night.
Steve Ballmer can I please redesign the Clippers mascot
I believe in us
I think human beings can create a Utopia.
I care about quality
I care about truth.
I care about our future.
I care about people.
everyone can say anything they want about me but they could never say that I didn't care.
I have discovered my single greatest quality.  I care.
What do you mean by @JustinBieber was my favorite song of 2015
mood https://t.co/msQNDIoHgA
No more fashion calendar... I'm going Mad Max... 6 collections a year...3 albums a year
https://t.co/PysZQ6d2gD
and yes Run is on my all time top ten list!!!
I feel like Rev Run, God MC tweeting positive energy while sitting in the bathroom!
Let's start the day off right!!! And y'all know what I'm bout to say now ...#allpositivevibes!!!!!!
My whole family loves you and your family and we appreciate the moment you helped realize on the Beams!!!
I love you. My dad loves you.
Thank you Kirk for standing by me through all the noise.
The choir arrangement that Kirk orchestrated is the most powerful thing I've heard in my earthly existence.
A lot of people tell me Ultralight Beam is my greatest artwork to date only rival being Jesus Walks.
Be strong today little bro!  “Come to me, all of you who are tired and have heavy loads, and I will give you rest. MATTHEW 11:28”
I just received a blessing from minister Kirk Franklin
Olivier designed clothes for my show… That was real,   that was groundbreaking,  that is a Real Friend.
Be real…
Don’t try to use me for advertisement or to make your proposed trend relevant.
If you wouldn’t invite me to your house then don’t invite me to your show.
Fake Fake Fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake … just my analysis
So many people turned on her when she was fired and acted like they forgot the innovation and beauty that she brought to the world…
The fashion world is sooooooo fake and Carine is one of the very few real people in fashion…
I like T-shirts and women in yoga pants… I live in LA that’s what people wear… not sure why someone would put a suit jacket on with that.
All these journalists can give their opinions well these are mine…yes I believe in my ripped homeless sweaters!!!
Sorry I couldn’t be at Virgil’s show because I had a meeting in another city.
this is my friend and we've bounced ideas and references for years since the time when he designed for YEEZY Season 1.
I thank Demna for using the "I feel like Pablo" sweatshirts in his show,
I thank Olivier for designing his collection around my wife… this is visionary as I believe that Kim is our modern day everything.
Oh and I only came to Paris fashion to stand by my friends Olivier, Riccardo and Demna.
Just cause somebody is wearing combat boots doesn’t mean it’s all of a sudden youth.
I also hate all the stylists that copy Hedi Slimane and give their clients blatant YSL looks thinking that it will bring a younger client.
I feel we are so stuck in the past and tradition.
I especially hate suit jackets on women… that was a groundbreaking idea 5 million years ago!
I don’t personally like suit jackets anymore.
excited to see my family and finish the final mixes of the Life of Pablo and keep working on Turbo Grafx 16 and Season 4 ….
I’m on a plane coming back from Europe…
Get Top on the phoooone!!!!!  @Kendricklamar
we win
the pure of heart win…
the thinkers win…
the artists win...
the future thinkers win…
Together we stand… we win…
Thank you to @asvpxrocky for supporting me at the MSG show…
I guess in a media world where you never hear the truth, the truth can come off as crazy…
It’s been a lot of confusion in the past 3 weeks so let me apologize for in any way being confusing…
. @Adidas is making a million Yeezys this year, opening up new factories…
Feeling like Robin Hood…
what war?  a class war… a war against time…
sometimes the quiet moments feel like I’m home from battle…
can’t wait to get home to North, Saint and my wife…
Met with @Hermes_Paris family yesterday… been out here fighting for 13 years and it feels like we’re finally seeing wins…
Was speaking with @souljaian earlier about a new idea…
So proud of my brother @VirgilAbloh with his new @OffWht collection!!!
bear with me guys, Rome wasn’t built in a day but I promise to keep my promises…
really happy to get the quality of the products better at half the prices of last year…
Sitting with @Robinnowicki from @ustwo working on the YEEZY site…
playing the new Kendrick…  1 thousand images on the desktop…  Hennessy &amp; what’s left of the ice and coke zero…
Super inspired by my visit to Ikea today , really amazing company… my mind is racing with the possibilities…
Up late designing in Sweden…
please see these next tweets as such because the ideas will jump around a bit… a bit like a mood board...
this is a stream of consciousness… twitter poetry…
Thank you Carine for believing in the vision, You are a visionary https://t.co/f13xrRC5W9
muse https://t.co/JeXMTsZKmQ
###hashtag all positive vibes
please avoid trying to talk me out of being me in the future
Growing and learning but not being told to stop ...not being stunted.
I want people to be the best version of themselves and I will be the best version of me.
question... Why do people not want me to be me?
uuuuuuum, so there it is... No more CDs from me
the Yeezus album packaging was an open casket to CDs r.i.p
I was thinking about not making CDs ever again... Only streaming
Uuuuum... hi everybody!
Tyler killed this https://t.co/YVzyTXE1Bu
Love this video https://t.co/Ar8wrpQ95q
Playing the new Nigel Holt album in Paris …  this is the perfect vibe right now! https://t.co/t047o2i0Vi https://t.co/qvojAjJNWM
we need to bring Max B, Lord (Timothy Ballard) and Barkim back home @nas @FrenchMontana #Harlem #QB
I promised Obama Ima do beats on NAS’ next album…
I want to stream you performing in a Minnie Mouse head on @TIDALHiFi
I’m very detailed oriented and I will know the difference so don’t try to just throw a bow on the original head…
I need you to perform at her party with specifically a minnie mouse dead-mow-five head… not a mickey mouse dead-mow-five head.
can you please bring the minnie mouse head … not yours   she specifically likes minnie mouse …
Do you do birthday parties?? My daughter loves Minnie mouse…
# I’m bored  ### when you get married will your wife have a giant minnie mouse head? # This brightened up my day… thank you dead-mow-five
# hash tag you raised Tidal’s subscriptions by a whopping 🐭🐭🐭downloads
# ok another super serious question   ...  is there a portable fan situation?
# whose job is it to carry the head on the plane # hash tag #  do you check the mickey mouse head or carry on #  does it get  hot?
# ok very serious question…
@Deadmau5 … is this person’s name pronounced dead-mow-five?
New project with 2 Chainz and Wayne dropping this Friday https://t.co/IZwN3mnkIS
Day 3 https://t.co/zPw0eFEFGF
Finally!!! Our guy!!! We're so so happy for Leo!!!
It is so inspiring.  Thank you for existing!
and also let’s shout out to the art direction … candy on the screens!
I just want to thank Will Ferrell for the years of joy he has brought into my life with amazing comedy
We all know Will Ferrell has always been the one!!!
that showed how sharp and Bruce Lee status he is.
Perhaps it was seeing him play the same character from 15 years ago with 15 more years experience
His existence is a blessing.
Will Ferrell has reached walking living breathing god status!
I saw Zoolander 2 for the 2nd time
correction, the name of the Neo Geo game I was referring to was The Super Spy
We actually played Spy Hunter at my mom’s house!!!
My boy Mali that I spoke about on the song Drive Slow actually had a Neo Geo in real life bro…
Blazing Lazers was probably my favorite game on that console …
just on some super nerd vibes… one of my favorite gaming systems when I was a kid…
My next album is titled   "Turbo Grafx 16"   as of now…
This best explains my experience in fashion and with fashion people in general   https://t.co/rY7o51TDss
number 1 streamed song this week https://t.co/wdsIr7NzhR
Kirk Franklin just sent me a blessing. I needed that. Thank you minister.
There are some lame fake accounts trying to make Kanye-isms that are not Mark Twain level.
Hi @Jack Dorsey, can you guys please take down all the fake Kanye accounts.
I'm not a rapper.
I just thought of the craziest idea of all ... I'm going to sell winter coats in the winter!!!
I'm going to steal Demna from Balenciaga
You won't always agree with me but I'm gon always be me. I'm woke!
The world needs a guy like me. The world needs somebody to not be scared and tell his truth.
I love being a voice of freedom when so many people are scared to speak up.
I represent what people can't say.
New album coming this summer
I'm not even gon lie to you. I love me so much right now.
And yes I've talked to Adidas and we gon hook y'all up with free Yeezys and Adidas.  All positive vibes.
That is one of the reasons I respect the paps so much.
Respect to everyone working hard to keep a roof over their kids
What is your definition of true freedom? There is no true freedom without economic freedom.
I just had to start with shoes so that I could be economically empowered enough to have a voice.
You guys will see my heart. You guys will feel my heart. We will make a difference.
It's a beautiful time.  I love my friends. I love my family.  I love people. The human race.
Free from being held back by public opinion.
I'm happy and free and proud and confident. I'm not crazy. I'm free
I'm proud as an entrepreneur that I gave everything I had to my dreams.
I wrote Saint Pablo after admitting to my greatest shame my personal debt. But I'm not ashamed anymore.
No slave mindset no more. I'm free. I'm free. I'm free.
I'm not crazy I'm free.
People ask why I speak in a public forum... Well my voice is my power. Freedom of speech. Freedom of opinion. Freedom of dreams.
We need to see Young Thug at the Grammys.  Not just me and Jay in a suit.
First order of business. We the people need to see Future at the Grammys.
and always remember that rock and roll was stolen and don't try to hide behind Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis 😭😭😭 all positive vibes.
Us real music guys wanna have fun too
Neil please reach out as soon as possible so we can make the Grammys culturally relevant again.
All artists have a problem with it and I am going to fix it for us all starting right now.
Has anyone at the Grammys ever heard March Madness??? Yes I have a problem with the Grammys.
You like your black people a certain way also. You wouldn't have Future perform and that man owned the clubs last summer.
You guys are supposed to be all about taste.
Dexter didn't feel he even had a chance of winning and he was right!!!
Everybody with any form of taste knows that was the best video of the year!
I don't want to just fix the awards for me but I want to fix it for Dexter Navy who directed A$AP Rocky’s LSD video.
If I'm not at the show next year then there is no show.
Hi Grammys this is the most important living artist talking.
I feel the Grammy awarding system is way off and completely out of touch.
I don't give opinions because they are commonly agreed upon. I say what I feel.
We need to fix this.
I know so many cool artists whose hearts have been broken by the politics including mine.
I think the Grammys are super important!!!
I would like to sit down with Neil Portnow right now
I really didn’t mean to use the B word tonight    …  all positive vibes
God bless the fools … all positive vibes!
Ezrin I truly feel sorry for your friends and family that they have had to suffer an idiot like you for so many years…
Welcome to pop culture!!!
I made Dark Fantasy and Watch the Throne in one year and wasn’t nominated for either and you know who has 2 albums of the year.
Rock and Roll was stolen… Rap was exploited…
it’s guys like you that run companies and don’t invest in Ye even if I’m your kid’s idol!!!
Bob please never speak in public again… you are everything that is wrong with the old guard …
Bro you said Macklemore was more important musically than me… no offense to Macklemore, he’s a nice human being!
I’m so sorry for them…   I will send them free Yeezys to make up for the embarrassment that you have caused your family!
Your kids are ashamed of their dad…  Sorry for speaking about kids…  but could you imagine if you were Bob Ezrin’s kids…
Do something relevant… Please don’t speak on me bro ever again!!!
I’m tired of old people that have no connection with anything trying to comment on music!
What the fuck does he know about rap…
Has anybody ever heard of Bob Ezrin???
If you are an entrepreneur you may have debt and lawsuits #facts
new song with my brothers French Montana and Nas https://t.co/yFmyJW4zD6 https://t.co/BWHFcPfkwT
My Heart https://t.co/Yt11QcelpN
Loving this mood for SEASON 4 https://t.co/HIq32PbMoc
Feels good to be home https://t.co/rhKN9xaC1F
Drake would come by and just help, no strings. Future also came by to write. We all got new shit together that's gonna drop soon.
I wanna thank my brother Drizzy for helping me on 30 Hours &amp; Father Stretch My Hands.
Season 4 begins. Première Vision https://t.co/LAlvRnlUgG
My number one enemy has been my ego…  there is only one throne and that’s God's  …
In rap we have been developing a brotherhood…
There is so much positive energy right now …  Let’s stay on this Ultra Light Beam…
A wise man should be humble enough to admit when he’s wrong and change his mind based on new information…
Some rappers got the club … Some got the radio… some got the conscience…some got the streets… Everybody has something they do the best…
every rapper is somebody’s favorite…
that statement has’t been sitting well with me… That’s a dated mentality   ... I’m not on that …
Man, I was thinking about when I commented on the idea of "taking the rap throne” …
Just creating in a fun simple way with no politics…
Imagine if the people I named went to high school 2gthr and had a project to do for school…
all with one purpose of creating  beautiful product that can be attainable by everyone…
A dream of mine would be to do a project where I  work side by side with Raf Simmons,  Helmut Lang, Vanessa Beecroft and Martin Margiela
Stream THE LIFE OF PABLO on https://t.co/shjFIS65Ia
Hey Nicolas Ghesquiere I grew up on Tron too… Let’s be best friends!!!
I’d rather teachers got paid more and books cost less … #2020
We have to lower the price of textbooks…
Education puts Americans into debt before they even get a chance to get started…
Steve Jobs wanted to lower the cost of textbooks…
she’s giving everything she has to make sure her son has a better future…
I mean, his mom has to work 2 days just to afford 1 book for her son …
Her son just got in a really good school and his textbooks are like $400 dollars each …
I have a friend who works really hard and makes $370 dollars a day…
All positive energy
so many people were inspired  and that’s all I wanted…
MSG was amazing …
You let me dream without limits….
They provided resources for me to create… they supported me …  I thank you so so much  …
Adidas has really made all the difference …
Thank you Adidas  for supporting my creative vision …
Pablo is full of joy and love because I was able to create….
I hope these words and this moment of truth can serve as some extra motivation to you…
for anybody listening to Pablo now, working on a dream
so people laughed when I said I wanted to be able to take care of my family …
but if you don’t have your paper right, there's a chance that your family can be broken up
when Sway was telling me what to do, I was in debt, and had a child…
When Charlemagne was calling me "donkey of the day" I was in debt
I can see the clouds separating …
I’m  an artist…  the definition of art - or at least my definition - is to be able to see the truth and then express it...
I don’t have to be cool…
perhaps a fashion group will cover the 53 that I’ve invested over the past 13 years…
Perhaps Adidas will do some big Lebron style deal or  …
my dreams brought me into debt and I’m close to seeing the light of day…
this country was built off of dreamers …   never give up on your dreams, bro…
You can point fingers and laugh, but for all entrepreneurs with families  ...
I wanted the world to know my struggle…
Money doesn’t make me who I am…
You can’t control me or use the debt against me no more   …
For the past 3 years people who knew about the debt tried to use it against me in negotiations …
only problem I got with Good Fridays is I got more songs than I got old pictures!!!! Lol!!!!
Also all Good Fridays songs will be on Tidal. Me and Kendrick got 40 songs and me and Young Thug got 40 songs. 40/40 club!!!
Please to all my friends fans and music lovers. Sign up to Tidal now.
My album will never never never be on Apple. And it will never be for sale... You can only get it on Tidal.
This was made with love. Only God can judge me. So I only expect love back!!!
Shut the fuck up and enjoy the greatness.
Aight then …
Don't tell me Lebron had a bad game. What yo jump shot look like???
The system is designed for colored people to fail and one of our only voices is music. One of our only ways out is music.
I love love love white people but you don't understand what it means to be the great grandson of ex slaves and make it this far.
To Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, New York Times, and any other white publication. Please do not comment on black music anymore.
Puff Daddy is the most important cultural figure in my life. His influence means everything to me.
Pitchfork, the album is a 30 out of 10
People wanted me to tweet again well here's some tweets!!!
and a balance art family perception friends family politics and the fucking manipulators
No matter what level you're at in life there is still a struggle
but if the self proclaimed cockiest person in the world can lay his personal business on the line then please people see my heart.
This is a God dream
I know I confuse you guys sometimes but please bare with me.
I am ultra light beaming right now. So many people have called or emailed to help today hedge fund guys billionaires etc...
I am of service to the world with my art and I just want to serve more.
and I think the idea of being a celebrity a lot of times blocks the understanding of what my purpose is.
There are people who support artist and philanthropist
I could not have done the MSG without Adidas but world, what I'm telling you is that was just a small sketch for what I will bring you.
Also for anyone that has money they know the first rule is to use other people's money.
If I spent my money on my ideas I could not afford to take care of my family. I am in a place that so many artist end up.
but I need access to more money in order to bring more beautiful ideas to the world.
Yes I am personally rich and I can buy furs and houses for my family
I want to help the world and I need help to do it. I am an artist and I care about humanity.
I just feel rich people are always too cool to ask for help trying to impress each other at dinner parties.
...on another note, can brah be the girl verson of bruh???
and yes there are misspellings on this chart… that’s how you know it’s me...
All you guys had meetings with me and no one lifted a finger to help….
I promise I’m going to make the world dope…. all I do is make shit dope #facts…
if you want to help… help me…
you’d rather open up one school in Africa like you really helped the country…
All you dudes in San Fran play rap music in your homes    but never help the real artists…
hey Larry Page I’m down for your help too …
Here is my Donda chart that I wrote 4 years ago that everyone laughed at… https://t.co/g1po6Z3H55
I know I can make the world a better place… I have done the impossible … I retook the throne of rap… I beat the fashion game…
and I will always respect you for that and the world will love you…
one of the coolest things you could ever do is to help me in my time of need
Mark, I am publicly asking you for help…
I don’t have enough resources to create what I really can…
I’m this generation's Disney… I want to bring dope shit to the world…
World, please tweet, FaceTime, Facebook, instagram, whatever you gotta do to get Mark to support me…
You love hip hop, you love my art… I am your favorite artist but you watch me barely breathe and still play my album in your house …
Mark Zuckerberg  I know it’s your bday but can you please call me by 2mrw…
I put Lowlights on my album just thinking about all the moms driving they kids to school then going to work…
Bars are worth more than money because it's something the people can use everyday to feel inspired.
I know y'all tired of music controlled by money and perception.  I'm proud of every dime of debt I got.
All y'all so worried about being likable but only a few are concerned about being great!!!
I am the Jordan and Steph Curry of music, meaning I'm the best of 2 generations.
I made Dark Fantasy and Watch the Throne in one year and wasn't nominated for either ... I will have over 100 Grammys before I die.
I made Dark Fantasy and Watch the Throne in one year and wasn't nominated for either ...
I'm practicing my Grammy Speech. I'm not going to the Grammys unless they promise me the Album of the Year!!!
Tidal is also funding a lot of my scripted content ideas.  It's a new day people.  More Ultra Light Dreams to be realized.
Man thank you so so so much everyone for signing up to Tidal. Tidal is now the number one app in the world!!! https://t.co/O3r9DkX03R
Please for all music lovers. Please subscribe to tidal!!! I decided not to sell my album for another week. Please subscribe to tidal.
Ima fix wolves
after realizing he is the greatest living artist and greatest artist of all time.
Mark Zuckerberg invest 1 billion dollars into Kanye West ideas
https://t.co/CGJ5PYLq67
They are calling me to the SNL stage now ... Speak soon...
This is all all is fun all in good feelings... We will all be gone 100 years from now but what did we do to help while we were here!!!
I write this to you my brothers while still 53 million dollars in personal debt... Please pray we overcome... This is my true heart...
Let's dance in the streets. I am consumed by my purpose to help the world.
All memes are wrong... The Life of Paul... The life of Pablo... Ultralight beams... Moms dads daughters sons stand up...
Please forgive the profanity and give hugs and blessings to my brother Kirk for standing by me... In a few hours the journey begins...
He was saved from persecution due to his Roman citizenship... I have the right to speak my voice...
He was a learned man not of the original sect so he was able to take the message to the rest of the world...
Paul ... The most powerful messenger of the first century... Now we stand here 20 centuries later... Because he was a traveler...
.... awwwwww... https://t.co/TLXZhIEvmQ

I’M SO HYPE RIGHT NOW    EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED  … HAVE YA’LL EVER SEEN TRON? THE END OF THE TRON WHERE EVERYTHING LIGHT UP!!!!
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA FUCK ALL THE HATERS   PUT YOUR MIUTHERFUCKING FIST IN THE SKY RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!
and was there in full support to see me realize this dream…
and I’m proud of this picture with me and Caitlyn… She gave the most heart felt speech at my wedding https://t.co/vt76mwqfnH
I’ve given everything I had for this moment… a lot of people feel it’s the paradigm shift …
fashion ain’t no joke for me… It’s a way of life… creative expression and industry…
so many people didn’t make it and gave everything they had for me to stand on their shoulders and break through fashion…
Your site is entertaining and hilarious but certain things are just too far… you have no idea what I’ve had to go through …
I’m a human being… I’m an artist, bro…
you probably got bootleg Yeezy’s on right now…
but Media Takeout couldn’t say one thing positive knowing damn well you’d love to be on the YEEZY 350 list…
people were crying… people were throwing up the fist… people were dancing…
I had an album listening and clothing presentation and Madison Square Garden…
respect the struggle… respect the hustle… respect the dreams…  respect the movement…
You seem like the type of organization hired to always keep dreamers down… when certain things in history happen you just got to respect it…
Now - Media Takeout - always remember that you dissed the collection that changed the world.
It’s Chance's fault the album not out yet… he really wanted Waves on that Bitch…  we in the lab now...
There would be no MSG without @iamdiddy my OG. He fought this war 15 years ago. Respect OG.
You have supported me since the beginning and I'm so happy to call you my friend!!!
The boss: thank so much Anna for coming to my show!!! https://t.co/VAwzk0SDUw
The album is being mastered and will be out today… added on a couple of tracks… https://t.co/6lBxcd83N2
Now that the album is finally finished it’s back to Good Fridays. https://t.co/j5vq347xCC
I want to be the creative director of Hermes…
not just the famous people there    but the kids   the moms the dads  the families that came to share this moment with us
9th   It felt like a seen from The Warriors     ALL GODS   ALL GODS ALL GODS in the buildin
but you can see at Madison Square Garden that you can stop us
8th   They want to control us with money and perception and mute the culture
7th  I miss that feeling  so that’s what I want to help restore
That’s why music is so fucking watered down right now    I miss that DMX feeling
6th  Stop trying to demonize real artist     Stop trying to compromise art
I can’t be mad at Kanye because he made me famous!  #FACTS
She was having dinner with one of our friends who’s name I will keep out of this and she told him
5th  thing I’m not even gone take credit for the idea… it’s actually something Taylor came up with …
4th Bitch is an endearing term in hip hop  like the word Nigga
3rd thing    I called Taylor and had a hour long convo with her about the line and she thought it was funny and gave her blessings
2nd thing   I asked my wife  for her blessings and she was cool with it
First thing is I’m an artist and as an artist I will express how I feel with no censorship
I did not diss Taylor Swift and I’ve never dissed her…

Aye Billboard you could use the term “unauthorized" but never refer to anything that me and Tyler do as fake out of respect to musicians…
@billboard … it’s not a fake cover… you seen it didn’t you… you know we shot it didn’t you…
Should this be a Rolling Stone cover?  Yes or No
I bet you this still becomes the cover though... Let's do another poll.....

ROLLING STONE SHOT BY TYLER THE CREATOR https://t.co/lOMtOdOEel
So many musicians touch my life and made me who I am…    I want to make something great to honor my idols…

God’s dream…   Never speak on kids again…   all love … all blessings…
I’m not into that kind of shit…  I like pictures and videos     Me and my wife got the kind of love that can turn exes into best friends
Exes can be mad but just know   I never let them play with my ass…    I don’t do that… I stay away from that area all together
I’m happy that I now know that KK means weed…  please excuse the confusion …  now back to #WAVES
Man it’s a sad a day… Wiz lost 2 million followers since I tweeted      I didn’t mean to either him like that.

Seems like just yesterday we were interning at Fendi - now you’re nominated for the LVMH Young Designer Prize.
I am so proud of my family Virgil Abloh.
If you wanna have a drink with me, book a table at the spotted pig when I’m back in NY.
We want to innovate and we will win someday.
All we have are our dreams, and you can step on our dreams and ideas all you want, but we won’t stop fighting.
Fame is often looked down upon in the design world, so it’s actually been something I had to overcome.
because I was too famous by the time I realized I wanted to design.
I don’t call myself a designer as I was not allowed to go to Saint Martins
I have millions of ideas and I represent a new generation just trying to express themselves in a broken world.
and I have encountered countless amounts of bigotry along the way.
To Fern Mallis: I just want you to understand that attempting to do clothing has been very difficult

The doors may be heavier, but I promise you WE WILL BREAK THEM.
Ten years later I am still the same kid from Chicago, still dreaming out loud, still banging on the door.
I wake up every day trying to give something back to you that you can rock to and be proud of.
I am honored and humbled by my fans, for the unwavering support and love over the past ten years.
gave of their heart to that project, and to all the projects that followed, and are to come.
I am extremely grateful to each and every person along that road who helped, lent an ear, lent their voice,
to not only convince my peers and the public that I could be an artist, but to actually get that art out for the world to hear.
I say "finally" because it was a long road, a constant struggle, and a true labor of love
Ten years ago today we finally released what had been my life's work up to that point: The College Dropout.

Thank you, Mandela, for your life's work and may it serve as a guiding light to illuminate our future.
At a young age my mother taught me the importance of his work. Mandela sacrificed his life for the betterment of mankind.
I'd like to address the false stories and noise that have been engineered by the media.
Despite recent media reports, I've never said anything to dishonor or trivialize the life or transition of one of the most inspiring leaders
Respect to Mandela, his family and his legacy.

I open the debate… The 2nd verse of New Slaves is the best rap verse of all time….meaning … OF ALL TIME IN THE HISTORY OF RAP MUSIC, PERIOD
http://t.co/hkUH7FrnNh
And to who ever leaked the video…     FUK YOU!
Allow me and Nick to give the world what we've been losing sleep over.
So any website that may have the unapproved / unfinished ruff. I ask you to please take it down.
The final version will be ready within the next week.
Me and Nick Knight have been working on this video for 5 months and for creatives it's heartbreaking when something like this happens.
